# Stock Price Prediction using Python and the LSTM Machine Learning Model

## Description
This project uses Python and the LSTM machine learning model to predict the stock price of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA). It demonstrates the application of LSTM in forecasting stock prices through a comprehensive, step-by-step implementation guide.

## Installation
To use this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `keras`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib keras
```

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PrashanthReddy47/StockPricePrediction_LSTM.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the local repository on your machine:
    ```sh
    cd StockPricePrediction_LSTM
    ```

3. Open the `StockPricePrediction_LSTM.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.

4. Set the `ticker` variable to the stock ticker you want to predict the price for (default is TSLA).

5. Run the notebook to train the LSTM model and make predictions.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following libraries:
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `keras`

Make sure these libraries are installed before running the script.

## Demo
A demonstration of the project can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `StockPricePrediction_LSTM.ipynb`.
